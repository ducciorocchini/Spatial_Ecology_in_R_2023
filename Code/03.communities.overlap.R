# The unit of time is the day, so values range from 0 to 1. 
# The package overlap works entirely in radians: fitting density curves uses trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan),
# so this speeds up simulations. The conversion is straightforward: kerinci$Time * 2 * pi
kerinci$timeRad <- kerinci$Time * 2 * pi

# selecting the first species
tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="tiger",]

# selecting the time for the tiger
timetig <- tiger$timeRad
densityPlot(timetig, rug=TRUE)

# selecting the second species
maca <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="macaque",]

# selecting the time for the tiger
timemaca <- maca$timeRad
densityPlot(timemaca, rug=TRUE)

# overlap!
